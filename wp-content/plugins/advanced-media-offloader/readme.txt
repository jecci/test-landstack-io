Save server space & speed up your site by automatically offloading media to Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2 & more.

== Description ==

**Advanced Media Offloader** helps you optimize your WordPress media handling by automatically uploading your media files to S3-compatible cloud storage services.

Struggling with server space limitations? Want to improve your site's performance by serving media through a CDN? This plugin handles the technical work of migrating your media to the cloud, rewriting URLs, and maintaining compatibility with your existing content.

= Key Benefits =

* Reduce server storage requirements and costs
* Decrease server load when serving media files
* Improve global site loading speeds when combined with CDN services
* Maintain full compatibility with WordPress media functions
* No need to modify existing content - URLs are automatically rewritten

= Supported Cloud Providers =

* **Amazon S3** - The industry standard object storage service
* **Cloudflare R2** - S3-compatible storage with zero egress fees
* **DigitalOcean Spaces** - Simple object storage from DigitalOcean
* **Backblaze B2** - Affordable S3-compatible storage with predictable pricing
* **Wasabi** - Hot cloud storage with predictable pricing
* **MinIO** - Any S3-compatible storage (MinIO, OVHcloud Object Storage, Scaleway, Linode, Vultr, IBM COS, and more)

== Features ==

* **Automatic Offloading** - New media uploads are automatically sent to your cloud storage
* **Smart Policies** - Create advanced rules to control exactly which files are offloaded and when, giving you granular control over your storage. ([Learn more](https://wpfitter.com/blog/implementing-smart-retention-policies-with-advanced-media-offloader/))
* **Bulk Migration & WP CLI** - Easily move existing media to the cloud with powerful command-line support for bulk operations and automation ([Learn more](https://wpfitter.com/blog/advmo-bulk-offload-with-wp-cli))
* **Thumbnail Regeneration Compatibility** - Compatible with WP-CLI `wp media regenerate` command and the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin. Regenerated thumbnails automatically offload to cloud storage. Note: Not compatible with Full Cloud Migration retention policy.
* **Smart URL Rewriting** - All media URLs are automatically rewritten to serve from cloud storage
* **File Versioning** - Add unique timestamps to media paths to prevent caching issues
* **Flexible Retention** - Choose to keep local copies or remove them after successful offloading
* **Mirror Deletion** - Optionally remove files from cloud storage when deleted from WordPress
* **Custom Paths** - Configure custom path prefixes in your cloud storage
* **Developer-Friendly** - Action hooks for extending functionality


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/advanced-media-offloader/` or install directly through WordPress
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to "Media Offloader" in the admin menu to configure settings
4. Add your cloud provider credentials to `wp-config.php` (see configuration examples below)
5. Test your connection and start offloading media

== Configuration ==

For security, cloud provider credentials are stored in your `wp-config.php` file rather than the database.

**Note:** Domain and endpoint URLs will automatically be prefixed with `https://` if you don't include it, but we recommend always including the full URL for clarity.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin support other cloud storage platforms? =

Currently supports Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2, DigitalOcean Spaces, MinIO & Wasabi. Additional providers are on the roadmap based on user demand.

= What happens to the media files already uploaded on my server? =

Existing files remain untouched until you explicitly use the bulk offload feature. New uploads are automatically processed based on your settings.

= How exactly does URL rewriting work? =

The plugin hooks into WordPress core media functions using `wp_get_attachment_url` and related filters. This ensures compatibility with themes, plugins, and core functions without modifying database URLs.

= Can I rollback if needed? =

Files offloaded with "Retain Local Files" can be served locally by deactivating the plugin. For full cloud migrations, you'll need to re-download media files if you want to revert.

= How are image sizes and thumbnails handled? =

All generated image sizes are offloaded alongside the original. URL rewriting works for all sizes and srcset attributes.

= Will this work with page builders and media-heavy plugins? =

Yes, since the plugin uses WordPress core hooks for URL rewriting, it's compatible with Elementor, Beaver Builder, WooCommerce, and most other plugins that use standard WordPress media functions.

= Does it support private files with access control? =

The free version only supports publicly accessible files. Private files with authenticated access may be added in a future premium version.

= What happens if I remove a media file from the WordPress Media Library? =

With "Mirror Delete" enabled, corresponding cloud files are automatically removed. Otherwise, files remain in cloud storage, potentially creating orphaned objects.

= How can I debug issues with file offloading? =

The plugin logs errors to attachment metadata. Check the Media Overview page for detailed error reporting or enable WordPress debug logging for more information.

= What's the recommended bucket configuration? =

For optimal performance:
1. Enable CORS configuration
2. Set appropriate public read permissions
3. Configure proper region (closest to your audience)
4. Consider using a CDN for global distributions

== Using the S3 PHP SDK ==

The Advanced Media Offloader utilizes the AWS SDK for PHP to interact with S3-compatible cloud storage. This powerful SDK provides an easy-to-use API for managing your cloud storage operations, including file uploads, downloads, and more. The SDK is maintained by Amazon Web Services, ensuring high compatibility and performance with S3 services.

For more information about the AWS SDK for PHP, visit:
[https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/)
